# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working in React Project

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied in a React project.  The issue is that the `hover` state is not working correctly.

## Problem

The `hover:bg-blue-700` class is not causing the button to change color on hover.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the correct configuration and setup are in place.  This often involves checking the following:

1. **Tailwind Configuration:** Verify that Tailwind is correctly configured in your `tailwind.config.js` file and that the correct paths are specified for your component files.
2. **PostCSS Configuration:** Check your PostCSS configuration to ensure that the Tailwind plugin is correctly included.
3. **Build Process:** Verify that your build process (e.g., Webpack, Vite) is handling Tailwind CSS correctly.
4. **PurgeCSS (if used):** If you use PurgeCSS, make sure the files with the classes are included in the `content` array. 
5. **Parent Element:** Ensure there are no parent element styles interfering with your Tailwind classes.
6. **Conflicting Styles:** Ensure you don't have any conflicting styles from other CSS sources.
7. **Correct Class Names:** Double-check that you have typed the class names correctly.
8. **Inspect Element:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and see what styles are actually being applied.
